# AI & ML Fundamentals

## 1. What is it?

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Definition:**  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines or software systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

**Common AI tasks include:**

- Recognizing faces in photos
- Understanding spoken or written language
- Playing games like chess or Go
- Driving cars autonomously
- Making recommendations or predictions

AI is a broad field that focuses on *making machines act intelligently*.

### Machine Learning (ML)

**Definition:**  
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows computers to learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

Instead of writing rules by hand, ML systems:

- Learn patterns from examples
- Improve automatically as they see more data
- Adapt to new situations without rewriting code

---

### The Relationship Between AI and ML

- **AI** is the goal → making machines intelligent  
- **ML** is the method → teaching machines using data  

Most modern AI systems are powered by machine learning.

## 2. Why is it needed?

### Limits of Traditional Programming

**Traditional programming works like this:**

- Humans write explicit rules
- Computers follow those rules exactly
- Works well for simple, predictable problems

**Examples where it works well:**

- Calculators
- Banking transactions
- Spreadsheet formulas
- Basic automation scripts

---

### Why This Approach Breaks Down

Some real-world problems are too complex for hand-written rules.

#### Example 1: Image Recognition

**Problem:** Detect whether a photo contains a cat.

**Traditional rule-based attempt:**

- If it has pointy ears  
- AND whiskers  
- AND four legs  

 **Why this fails:**

- Cats appear in many shapes, poses, and lighting conditions
- Some cats are partially hidden
- Some animals look similar to cats
- Impossible to write rules for every case

**ML approach:**

- Show the system thousands of labeled cat and non-cat images
- Let the model learn visual patterns automatically
- Works even on new images it has never seen before

---

#### Example 2: Language Translation

**Problem:** Translate English to French.

 **Rule-based systems fail because:**

- Languages have exceptions
- Words change meaning based on context
- Idioms don’t translate literally

 **ML approach:**

- Learn from millions of translated sentence pairs
- Capture grammar, context, and common usage patterns

---

### When Machine Learning Is Needed

ML is essential when:

- Problems are too complex for explicit rules
- Patterns exist but are hard to describe
- Large amounts of data are available
- The system must improve over time

---

## 3. How it works

### The Core Machine Learning Workflow

---

### Step 1: Gather Training Data

**What it means:**  
Collect examples that represent the problem you want to solve.

**Example: Spam Email Detection**

- 10,000 emails labeled **spam**
- 10,000 emails labeled **not spam**

Labeled data teaches the model what is correct.

---

### Step 2: Build a Model

**What it is:**  
A model is a mathematical structure that can learn patterns from data.

**Think of it as:**  
An empty brain waiting to be trained.

**Common model types:**

- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines

---

### Step 3: Training

**What happens during training:**

1. The model makes a prediction
2. The prediction is compared to the correct answer
3. The error is calculated
4. The model updates itself to reduce future errors
5. This process repeats many times

**Spam example:**

- Email: “Congratulations! You won $1,000,000!”
- Initial prediction: Not spam 
- Correct label: Spam 
- Model adjusts to recognize similar patterns as spam

---

### Step 4: Inference (Making Predictions)

**Inference means:**  
Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Example:**

- New email arrives: “Meeting tomorrow at 3 PM”
- Model predicts: Not spam
- Email goes to inbox

---

### Training vs. Inference

| Aspect | Training | Inference |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Purpose | Learn patterns | Apply learned patterns |
| Data | Labeled data | New, unlabeled data |
| Speed | Slow | Fast |
| Frequency | Occasional | Continuous |
| Resources | High (GPUs, large datasets) | Low (can run on devices) |

---

### Neural Networks (Simplified)

**What they are:**  
Neural networks are ML models inspired by the human brain.

**Basic structure:**

- **Input layer:** Receives raw data (e.g., image pixels)
- **Hidden layers:** Transform and analyze data
- **Output layer:** Produces a final prediction

**Why “neural”:**

- Each layer contains artificial neurons
- Neurons receive inputs, process them, and pass outputs forward

**Deep Learning:**  
Neural networks with many hidden layers.

---

## 4. Examples

### Example 1: Netflix Recommendations

**Goal:** Recommend movies users will enjoy.

**Training data includes:**

- Viewing history
- Ratings and likes
- Movie genres, actors, and release years

**Training outcome:**

- Learns user preferences
- Finds patterns across millions of users

**Inference:**  
When you open Netflix, the system predicts what you are most likely to watch next.

---

### Example 2: Medical Diagnosis

**Goal:** Detect tumors in X-ray images.

**Training data:**

- Thousands of X-rays labeled by doctors
- Images with and without tumors

**Model behavior:**

- Learns visual patterns of abnormalities

**Inference:**  
New X-rays are analyzed and suspicious regions are flagged for doctors.

---

### Example 3: Voice Assistants (Siri, Alexa)

Multiple ML systems work together:

1. **Speech Recognition**
   - Converts audio to text
2. **Natural Language Understanding**
   - Determines user intent
3. **Response Generation**
   - Produces a useful answer

Each step uses trained ML models.

---

### Example 4: Self-Driving Cars

**ML tasks involved:**

- Detecting objects (cars, pedestrians, signs)
- Predicting movement of other vehicles
- Planning safe paths

**Training data:**  
Millions of miles of labeled driving footage.
